===== Zabbix API =====

Zabbix API provides programmable interface to Zabbix for mass manipulations, 3rd party software integration and other purposes.

Currently Zabbix API specification is in draft state. All objects marked as 'draft' are experimental and should be used with a great care. We do not guarantee compatibility with future releases.

Object specifications without the 'draft' mark are stable and can be used for production purposes.

See [[http://www.zabbix.com/wiki/doc/api|Zabbix wiki]] for community provided solutions around the API.
