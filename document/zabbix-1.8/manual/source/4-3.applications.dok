Application is a set of host items. For example, application 'MySQL Server' may contain all items which are related to the MySQL server: availability of MySQL, disk space, processor load, transactions per second, number of slow queries, etc.

An item may be linked with one or more applications.

Applications are used in Zabbix front-end to group items.
