<h4>Added direct SNMP trap monitoring</h4>

<p>New SNMP trap monitoring provides high performance way of collecting traps, pre-processors such as SNMPTT could be used as well.</p>

<h4>Support of automatic selection of map icons</h4>

<p>Maps and map elements could be optionally configured to automaticall select icons depending on element type (for example: host, network device, switch, etc).</p>

<h4>Optional expanding of macros in map editing</h4>

<p>Added new option in map configuration which enables macros expanding.</p>

<h4>Host profiles renamed to inventory</h4>

<p>Host profiles were renamed to a more standard "host inventory".</p>

<h4>Performance improvements</h4>

<p>Trigger related data is cached to reduce number of database requests, it improves overall performance of Zabbix Server.</p>

<h4>New set of default templates</h4>

<p>Existing default templates were improved to take advantage of low level discovery, also added new templates.</p>

<h4>Automatic collection of host profile data</h4>

<p>Information about hardware and software details can be automatically retrieved by Zabbix Agent and extended using user-defined parameters.</p>

<h4>Enhanced auto-discovery</h4>

<p>Added discovery based on HTTPS and Telnet checks, discovery configuration form is redesigned.</p>

<h4>WEB monitoring by proxies</h4>

<p>WEB scenarios could be monitored by remote proxies. It allows monitoring of WEB applications from various geographical locations.</p>

<h4>Support of visible host and template name</h4>

<p>In addition to standart host name, visible host name can be set to be displayed everywhere in the front-end. Additional macros for visible host name are also introduced.</p>

<h4>Advanced options for remote commands</h4>

<p>Remote commands (Agent, IPMI and SSH based) can be configured in a more flexible yet easier way.</p>

<h4>Remote JMX monitoring</h4>

<p>Zabbix JMX monitoring allows native secure remote monitoring of Java applications and popular middlewares such as JBoss, WebSphere and WebLogic.</p>

<h4>Unified host profiles</h4>

<p>Normal and extended host profiles merged. Macros for referencing all profile fields introduced.</p>

<h4>Multiple network interfaces</h4>

<p>Multiple network interfaces can be assigned to a single host, therefore one host may have several IP addresses with different checks for each IP.</p>

<h4>Better translation framework for WEB interface</h4>

<p>Zabbix interface translations are handled by GNU gettext module.</p>

<h4>Auto-registration with passive checks</h4>

<p>Added support of monitoring auto-registered hosts with passive checks. It is very handy for monitoring of Cloud-like environments.</p>

<h4>Re-design of unknown events and triggers</h4>

<p>Unknown triggers and events will no longer be displayed in Zabbix WEB interface, a special flag will be shown if Zabbix is not confident about status of triggers or events.</p>

<h4>Low level discovery</h4>

<p>Zabbix is able to discover your file systems, network interfaces and SNMP interfaces automatically with no manual work. One template can be used for hosts having different devices. Lost resources could be automatically deleted based on configurable retention period.</p>

<h4>Much faster processing of escalations</h4>

<p>Processing of escalations has been improved to work more efficiently.</p>

<h4>Optional graph legends</h4>

<p>Graph legend can be optionally disabled.</p>

<h4>Templated host-level screens</h4>

<p>Templates may contain screens for easy maintenance and quick access to a set of performance graphs. The screens are available via host popup available when clicking on a host.</p>

<h4>Database integrity</h4>

<p>There are significant improvements in the database schema for better consistency and security of configuration and historical data.</p>

<h4>Nanosecond resolution for historical data</h4>
