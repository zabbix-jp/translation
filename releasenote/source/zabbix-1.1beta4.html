<h3>Use in production environments</h3>

<p>ZABBIX 1.1beta4 is BETA software, therefore we cannot recommend it for immediate use in production. Although tested throughout our release cycle, this release does not have the benefit of use in production environments that ZABBIX v1.0 has and therefore should be treated with the same level of caution as a new product.</p>
