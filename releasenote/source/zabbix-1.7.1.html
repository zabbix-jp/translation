<h3>What's New in 1.7.x (alpha)</h3>

<h4>Advanced cache module</h4>

<h4>Much more efficient polling</h4>

<p>Zabbix latest releases support running of hundreds of pollers. The pollers are very efficient and do not require connections to the database. Data processing parallelizm is greatly improved.</p>

<h4>GUI improvements</h4>

<p>Zabbix interface has been improved by introducing paging, selection of elements and mass-operations. The interface is tested to support very large number of monitored elements with very low impact on overall system performance. It is optimized for high performance yet easy to use.</p>

<p>Efficient filters have been introduced for most of configuration pages.</p>

<h4>Support of PHP 5.3</h4>

<p>Zabbix GUI fully supports PHP 5.3. Support for PHP 4.x dropped.</p>

<h4>Advanced support of maintenance periods</h4>

<p>Host and group level maintenance periods are supported. Very flexible timing can be defined for each maintenance period.</p>

<h4>Added support of bar graphs</h4>

<p>The bar graphs can be used in reports.</p>

<h4>Advanced screen editing</h4>

<p>Modification and creation of screens was simplified by adding support of drag-and-drop and new edit options.</p>

<h4>Support of complex regular expressions</h4>

<p>Regular expression builder helps to create and maintain complex regular expressions used for log monitoring.</p>

<h4>Improved auto-discovery</h4>

<p>Added support of network masks for IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Added new actions: enable/disable device. Added SNMPv3 based discovery checks. Also added support of port number intervals and devices with multiple-IP addresses.</p>

<h4>Support of auto-registration</h4>

<p>Hosts with installed Zabbix agents can be automatically added for monitoring.</p>

<h4>Support of template, host and global-level macros</h4>

<p>The macros will greatly simplify maintenance of large Zabbix setup with host specific configuration parameters.</p>

<h4>Better support of Oracle database</h4>

<p>Zabbix uses high-performance OCI library for Oracle connectivity. No dependency on Sqlora8 library anymore.</p>

<h4>Global search function</h4>

<p>Global search allows fast and easy access to hosts, templates and host groups.</p>

<h4>Better graphs</h4>

<p>Layout of graphs and navigation was improved for much easier operations and visibility of information.</p>

<h4>JSON-RPC based API</h4>

<p>Zabbix API provides easy and very efficient way of remote management and integration with 3rd party tools and services.</p>

<h4>Full support of UTF8</h4>

<p>Zabbix fully supports UTF8, which makes it ready for use with multiple languages.</p>

<h4>High performance monitoring of index based SNMP items</h4>

<p>Only single connection to SNMP agent is used.</p>

<h4>Advanced WEB monitoring</h4>

<p>WEB monitoring module supports basic authentication.</p>

<h4>Advanced ICMP based monitoring</h4>

<p>Existing ICMP monitoring was enhanced to support more detailed statistics including number of lost packets and min/max/avg timing.</p>

<h4>Advanced DNS monitoring</h4>

<p>Performance and availability of DNS resources can be effectively monitored.</p>

<h4>Zabbix command line tool</h4>
