<h4>ZABBIX Proxy process</h4>

<p>ZABBIX proxy is a lightweight process, which performs data collection on behalf of ZABBIX Server. The proxies can be used to create distributed centralised monitoring of remote locations all reporting to a central server or one of ZABBIX nodes.</p>

<p>ZABBIX Proxy significantly simplifies deployment and maintenances of large ZABBIX setups in a distributed environment.</p>

<h4>Dashboard</h4>

<p>The Dashboard provides high level personalized details about monitored environment. Now this is a central part of ZABBIX front-end.</p>

<h4>Dynamic screens</h4>

<p>A screen element can be made dynamic. In this case, information displayed in the element will  depend on a host selected by user.</p>

<h4>Nice zoom for graphs</h4>

<p>Zoom period can be selected by mouse for drill-down analysis.</p>

<h4>Database cache module</h4>

<p>Database cache module can be enabled to improve performance of busy ZABBIX servers.</p>

<h4>Pie charts</h4>

<p>Pie charts (both 2D and 3D) are supported.</p>

<h4>Basic management functions</h4>

<p>Traceroute and Ping can be executed from the Status of Triggers screen. More scripts can be added and configured. The scripts are executed on a local ZABBIX server or one of ZABBIX nodes.</p>

<h4>More efficient communication with agents</h4>

<p>ZABBIX Agent supports data buffering, which can be tuned by new configuration parameters, BufferSize and BufferSend. Communication protocol has been improved to support sending of multiple values by one TCP connection.</p>

<h4>More efficient ZABBIX sender</h4>

<p>ZABBIX Sender has been improved to support sending of multiple values by one TCP connection.</p>

<h4>Improved view of trigger statuses</h4>

<p>The screen will display information about triggers and associated events.</p>

<h4>Support of SNMP data having dynamic index</h4>

<p>A new syntax can be used to monitor SNMP data with a dynamic index. See SNMP section for more details.</p>

<h4>Special processing of well known SNMP OIDs</h4>

<p>Simple SNMP OIDs, like ifDescr, ifInOctets, ifInOctets, and other can be used in ZABBIX and will be translated automatically into correct numeric representation by ZABBIX itself.</p>

<h4>Added printable view for all screens</h4>

<p>Any screen can be printed in a nice way by pressing the Print link.</p>

<h4>Disabling of login rights for a group of users</h4>

<p>Whole user group can be configured not to have access to ZABBIX front-end.</p>

<h4>Added support of UTF-8</h4>

<p>ZABBIX front-end is UTF-8 ready. Note that ZABBIX database and ZABBIX server and agent processes are still not ready for correct processing of UTF-8 data.</p>

<h4>Added screen for better management of translations</h4>

<p>The screen can be used to add new translations of ZABBIX front-end.</p>

<h4>Added maintenance mode</h4>

<p>ZABBIX Maintenance mode can be activated to disable ZABBIX front-end.</p>

<h4>Unlimited number of map link styles</h4>

<p>Any number of triggers can be linked to map link. The triggers will define how the link is displayed.</p>
