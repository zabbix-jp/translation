<h4>Advanced cache module</h4>

<p>Advanced cache module is introduced to significantly improve performance of Zabbix Server and Proxy operations. Up to 10x better performance increase is expected comparing to 1.6.x releases. The cache module is permanently enabled and drastically decreases load on the back-end database.</p>
 
<h4>Much more efficient polling</h4>

<p>Zabbix latest releases support running of hundreds of pollers. The pollers are very efficient and do not require connections to the database. Data processing parallelism is greatly improved.</p>
 
<h4>GUI improvements</h4>

<p>Zabbix interface has been improved by introducing paging, selection of elements and mass-operations. The interface is tested to support very large number of monitored elements with very low impact on overall system performance. It is optimized for high performance yet easy to use.</p>
 
<p>Efficient filters have been introduced for most of configuration pages.</p>
 
<h4>Support of PHP 5.3</h4>

<p>Zabbix GUI fully supports PHP 5.3. Support for PHP 4.x dropped.</p>
 
<h4>Advanced support of maintenance periods</h4>

<p>Host and group level maintenance periods are supported. Very flexible timing can be defined for each maintenance period.</p>
 
<h4>Added support of bar graphs</h4>

<p>The bar graphs can be used for long-term trend analysis.</p>
 
<h4>Advanced screen editing</h4>

<p>Modification and creation of screens was simplified by adding support of drag-and-drop and new edit options.</p>
 
<h4>Advanced maps</h4>

<p>New drag and drop interface makes creating and editing maps much easier. Now maps support highlighting of map elements depending on severity of problems and host statuses.</p>
 
<h4>Detailed host availability information</h4>

<p>Host availability information is displayed separately for Zabbix Agent, IPMI and SNMP agents.</p>
 
<h4>Support of complex regular expressions</h4>

<p>Regular expression builder helps to create and maintain complex regular expressions used for log monitoring.</p>
 
<h4>Improved auto-discovery</h4>

<p>Added support of network masks for IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. Added new actions: enable/disable device. Added SNMPv3 based discovery checks. Also added support of port number intervals and devices with multiple-IP addresses.</p>
 
<h4>Support of auto-registration</h4>

<p>Hosts with installed Zabbix agents can be automatically added for monitoring.</p>
 
<h4>Support of template, host and global-level macros</h4>

<p>The macros will greatly simplify maintenance of large Zabbix setup with host specific configuration parameters.</p>
 
<h4>Agent-less monitoring based on Telnet and SSH</h4>

<p>Servers and network devices can be monitored using Telnet or secure SSH connections.</p>
 
<h4>Better support of Oracle database</h4>

<p>Zabbix uses high-performance OCI library for Oracle connectivity. No dependency on Sqlora8 library anymore.</p>
 
<h4>Global search function</h4>

<p>Global search allows fast and easy access to hosts, templates and host groups.</p>
 
<h4>Better graphs</h4>

<p>Layout of graphs and navigation was improved for much easier operations and visibility of information.</p>
 
<h4>JSON-RPC based API</h4>

<p>Zabbix API provides easy and very efficient way of remote management and integration with 3rd party tools and services.</p>
 
<h4>Full support of UTF8</h4>

<p>Zabbix fully supports UTF8, which makes it ready for use with multiple languages.</p>
 
<h4>High performance monitoring of index based SNMP items</h4>

<p>Only single connection to SNMP agent is used.</p>
 
<h4>Advanced WEB monitoring</h4>

<p>WEB monitoring module supports basic authentication.</p>
 
<h4>Advanced ICMP based monitoring</h4>

<p>Existing ICMP monitoring was enhanced to support more detailed statistics including number of lost packets and min/max/avg timing.</p>
 
<h4>Advanced DNS monitoring</h4>

<p>Performance and availability of DNS resources can be effectively monitored.</p>
 
<h4>Zabbix command line tool</h4>
