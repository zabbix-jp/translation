<p>This document contains the release notes for ZABBIX version 1.1beta5. The following sections describe the release in detail and provide late-breaking or other information that supplements the main documentation.</p>

<h3>What's New</h3>

<h4>Templating</h4>

<p>Templating has been fixed. Definition of items, triggers and graphs is propagated to linked hosts.</p>

<h4>New concept of definition of trigger actions</h4>

<p>The new concept allows much more flexible definition of trigger actions in one screen. Finally!</p>

<h4>New item type: Unsigned Integer 64bit</h4>

<p>The new type can be used for storage of integer data, such as SNMP counters, disk spaces, etc. No loss of data precision anymore. Note that the data will be  stored in new table 'history_uint'.</p>

<h4>New trigger function: regexp()</h4>

<p>The function allows to check if a value matches given Posix regular expression. It works for items having type String or Log.</p>

<h3>Use in production environments</h3>

<p>ZABBIX 1.1beta5 is BETA software, therefore we cannot recommend it for immediate use in production. Although tested throughout our release cycle, this release introduces many changes and does not have the benefit of use in production environments that ZABBIX v1.0 has and therefore should be treated with the same level of caution as a new product.</p>
